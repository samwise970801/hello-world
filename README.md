Hey! This is Samira! I am a student in chemical engineering. I am very interested to use data science in my engineering projects. I think it's a great intersection point. 
Learning a new skill is a big thing for me. I have been depressed for almost a year now. And one of my coping strategies is to learn for fun. This thought made me pursue data science and so far I am having a great time!
